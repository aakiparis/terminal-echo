## The Attenuation Event

What broke: ambition and abstraction

## The underpinned context

### A crisis
Human societies do fragment under stress. We have overwhelming historical and contemporary evidence for that. But they also re-aggregate far faster and more stubbornly than most fiction tells.

#### Humans are compulsive system-builders
Anthropologically, humans do not tolerate sustained anarchy well.
- Even hunter-gatherers had norms, enforcement, leadership rotation.
- In disasters (war zones, blackouts, state failure), people immediately form rules, markets, and informal governance.
- Black markets aren’t chaos — they are regulated systems without paperwork.

Implication:
A world of permanently isolated, ruleless settlements with no trade standards, shared symbols, or federations is deeply unrealistic past the short term.

#### The role of inventors and entrepreneurs
Inventors and entrepreneurs appear faster under collapse, not slower.
Scarcity doesn’t kill innovation — it rewards it more brutally.
- Crises compress feedback loops: bad ideas die quickly, useful ones spread fast.
- The “minority who pushes humanity forward” becomes more influential, not less.
- Power shifts from credentials to competence.

Implication:
- You’d expect Rapid tech bricolage
- Cross-settlement trade routes
- Proto-institutions (guilds, fixers, engineers, couriers)


#### Meaning and myth re-emerge immediately
Humans do not wait for stability to create shared narratives.
- Religions, ideologies, flags, and taboos arise during chaos.
- People need stories to coordinate behaviour before they need comfort.

Implication:
A morally flat, nihilistic post-collapse world is implausible. Something always tries to become the centre.

### Nevertheless, a collapse can last a long time

There are a few factors that can reshape well-established historical and anthropological norms.

#### Modern civilisation is hyper-specialised
No individual understands the whole system.
Recovery requires synchronised knowledge across domains.

Losing just a few keystone skills (semiconductors, logistics, antibiotics) massively slows recomposition.

#### Trauma reshapes risk tolerance
Populations that survive catastrophic failure become structurally risk-averse.
Centralisation is remembered as “what killed us”.
Localism feels safer, even if inefficient.
Elders transmit caution as wisdom.

Implication:
People may actively resist large-scale reunification, not out of ignorance but learned fear.

#### Incentives may no longer align with reunification
Human capacity to rebuild exists, but coordination costs skyrocket.
Fragmentation persists not because people won’t unify — but because they can’t agree on how.

This is crucial.
If:
- Local leaders gain power from isolation
- Trade works “well enough”
- Reunification introduces uncertainty
Then fragmentation becomes a rational equilibrium, not a failure.
No villain required.

## The game's philosophical fault line
The mistake many stories make is treating collapse as a new stable state, rather than a violent transition phase. What’s unrealistic is stasis:
- “This is how things are now. Forever.”
- Humans don’t settle into that.

The game questions:
- “Why has reunification not happened yet, despite human nature?”
- What has happened that time, that it went against human nature?

- Is humanity driven more by creative expansion, or by trauma avoidance?

## The Game

Shortly before the collapse, a global biomedical programme attempted to reduce mass anxiety and cognitive overload. The goal was noble: dampen panic, reduce radicalisation, increase emotional stability in a hyper-connected world.

The intervention worked — too well.

A subtle DNA expression shift spread globally. Humans retained intelligence, empathy, and cooperation, but lost abstract drive:
- long-term planning beyond the local
- tolerance for systemic complexity
- desire to build things they would never personally use
- ambition
- existential dissatisfaction

No explosion. No apocalypse. Just… attenuation.

### Why society degraded
Complex infrastructure does not fail from malice — it fails from lack of future-oriented attention.
- Power grids need people who care about failures years away.
- Logistics needs abstraction, trust in invisible systems.
- Governance requires belief in structures larger than oneself.
- As this cognitive trait faded, systems decayed gracefully, then irreversibly.

- maintenance feels pointless
- innovation feels indulgent

Settlements survived.
Civilisation didn’t.

Another angle:
Civilisation depended on:
- abstraction
- delegation
- black-box trust

Once people refused to maintain what they didn’t fully grasp:
- layered systems collapsed
- specialisation reversed
- networks simplified brutally


### Why reunion slowed to near stasis
People are not hostile to reunification.
They simply cannot feel its necessity.

The cost-benefit calculus collapses:
- Local comfort feels sufficient.
- Large systems feel alien, fragile, and unnecessary.
- “Why rebuild something we won’t personally maintain?”

The world enters limbo.


## The Game
### The player
You are a rare genetic reversion.

Your mutation restores:
- tolerance for abstraction
- think in systems
- act on incomplete knowledge

You don’t feel “chosen”.
You feel uneasy — constantly aware of missing connections.
This makes others uneasy around you.

Your journey begins when you encounter evidence that:
- This world once wanted more.

### Why the player starts the journey
You don’t start with a mission.
You start with confusion:
- “Why does nobody want to know how things work together anymore?”

Your journey begins when you realise you are alone in asking that question.

Then recognition.
Then obligation.


### Other NPCs
Others like you appear, not many:
- rebuilding networks, system tinkerers
- experimenting with federations, proto-governors
- archive keepers

They don’t agree.
Some want minimal order.
Some want enforced structure.
Some want careful reassembly.

Some become authoritarian.
Some become idealists.
Some burn out.


### The real conflict
Not good vs evil.

It’s:
- comfort vs responsibility
- local peace vs global risk
- humanity as feeling vs humanity as foresight

Counterforce isn't a villain; it's rather a cultural antibody. NPCs who say:
- “Last time, systems killed us.”
- “Complexity is arrogance.”
- “Simple is safe.”


### Moral dilemma
The game’s tension isn’t:
- “Can we rebuild?”
It’s:
- “Should we, and on whose terms?”

- Enforce system thinking onto people who never asked for it
- honour trauma and accept stagnation? Respect the limbo?
- Or persuade, educate, and risking another collapse?


## Storyline
### 1. Intro / Onboarding / Home 
Purpose:
Introduce attenuation without naming it, establish the player as different through friction, and push them out of “home” without melodrama.

Starting location: Low-Complexity Haven (Name flexible: The Still Quarter / The Sheltered Ring / Home Node)
A small, well-functioning settlement built entirely around local sufficiency:
 • Hand-maintained generators
 • Clear, simple rules
 • No hierarchy beyond caretakers
 • No expansion plans
 • No long-term projects

It is calm. Pleasant. Almost… finished.
People here are not stupid. They are kind, cooperative, and emotionally regulated.

Early onboarding interactions subtly fail for the player. A maintenance NPC says:
- “It works well enough. Why improve it?”
The player’s dialogue options include questions others never ask.
- A local planning board has no future dates beyond the next season.
- A map exists — but only for walking distance.
NPCs react to the player’s questions with mild discomfort, not hostility.

#### The trigger
A minor system failure happens:
- A relay node goes offline
- Not catastrophic, just inefficient
- Everyone adapts locally

The player realises: This failure didn’t have to happen — and won’t be fixed properly.

When the player proposes a networked fix, the response is:
- “That’s too much coordination.”
- “It’s safer to adapt than to depend.”
This is the first moment of existential unease.

#### The push beyond home
The player discovers an old signal fragment — not a distress call, but a system heartbeat from afar.
Crucially:
- No one else wants to investigate
- Not from fear — from indifference

A caretaker says:
- “If it mattered, it would still be working.”
The player leaves not to save anyone — but because they cannot ignore an unfinished system.
That’s the core of your onboarding.

### 2. Neon Nexus – First Clues
Purpose:
Reveal that the world did not simply break — it was softened. Introduce attenuation as an intentional act.

This should be the last place that tried to remain complex.
 • Flickering holographic signage
 • Semi-functional transit logic
 • Overgrown but still pulsing infrastructure
 • Not dead — exhausted

The name “Neon Nexus” should feel ironic now.
Neon Nexus is where:
 • Pre-collapse abstraction lingered longest
 • Early attenuation effects were noticed
 • The first trade-offs were consciously made

How it gives clues

Through misaligned artefacts, not exposition:

Environmental storytelling
 • Terminals full of abandoned future plans
 • Project timelines that stop mid-sentence
 • Research logs about “emotional stability improvements”

Nothing says “DNA mutation” outright yet.

⸻

NPC tone shift

NPCs here:
 • Are more articulate than elsewhere
 • But deeply suspicious of “big ideas”
 • Many are descendants of system engineers

They say things like:

“We finally stopped panicking.”
“The world became quieter.”
“That wasn’t a mistake.”

⸻

Suggested changes to existing context

If Neon Nexus already has:
 • Trade → make it local-loop trade, no long routes
 • Tech → make it maintenance tech, not innovation
 • Factions → make them custodians, not builders

Add:
 • A defunct Global Calm Initiative wing
 • An archive terminal that reacts unusually to the player (biometric resonance)

This is where the player first suspects:

“Something was changed in us — on purpose.”

⸻

3. Forgotten Outpost – Crystallising the Dilemma

Purpose:
Force the philosophical conflict into the open. No more ambiguity.

⸻

What Forgotten Outpost is

A place where reassembly almost happened.

• Old junction of trade routes
 • Partial federated governance ruins
 • Half-built infrastructure linking multiple settlements

It failed — not violently, but politely.

⸻

Core narrative

Long ago, a group like the player tried to:
 • Reintroduce abstraction
 • Build shared systems
 • Coordinate beyond locality

The effort collapsed when:
 • People opted out
 • Maintenance participation declined
 • Nobody sabotaged it — they just stopped caring

⸻

Key NPC archetypes here
 • The Burnt Architect – former system-builder, now bitter
 • The Comfort Keeper – ensures local peace, opposes expansion
 • The Silent Ally – another reversion like the player, unsure

They all believe they are right.

⸻

How quests support the dilemma

Existing quests (reframed)
 • Repair tasks → reveal why no one wanted to maintain them
 • Retrieval quests → uncover abandoned coordination protocols
 • Dialogue quests → force the player to argue for abstraction

⸻

New quest ideas

“The Unfinished Charter”
The player can:
 • Complete a federated agreement
 • Simplify it into local rules
 • Or archive it permanently

Each choice shapes how NPCs view future systems.

⸻

Narrative payoff

This location makes it explicit:

The world isn’t broken.
It’s traumatised — and adapted.

This is where the player realises:

Rebuilding will hurt people emotionally.

⸻

4. Rust Pit & Tech Depot – Full Moral Spectrum

Purpose:
Show the consequences of each ideological response.

⸻

Rust Pit – Enforced Progress

Theme: “Complexity through control”
 • Harsh efficiency
 • Strict protocols
 • Little consent

Run by a reversion NPC who believes:

“Humanity won’t choose the future. It has to be dragged into it.”

Quest ideas
 • Enforce maintenance quotas
 • Suppress local opt-outs
 • Optimise at human cost

You see progress — and resentment.

⸻

Tech Depot – Comforted Limbo

Theme: “Stability through refusal”
 • Comfortable lives
 • Minimal systems
 • No growth

Led by elders who say:

“We survived by stopping.”

Quest ideas
 • Dismantle complex tech
 • Preserve emotional equilibrium
 • Block network expansion

You see peace — and slow erosion.

⸻

The player’s position

You are pulled between:
 • Rust Pit’s results
 • Tech Depot’s ethics

Neither is wrong.
Neither is enough.

⸻

Final Narrative Spine

The world is not static.
It is slowed by biology, trauma, and learned caution.

The player is not a saviour.
They are a reintroduced trait.

The conflict is not:

“Will humanity survive?”

It is:

“What kind of humanity is allowed to exist again?”

And the final moral weight is this:

Progress is not free.
Comfort is not neutral.
